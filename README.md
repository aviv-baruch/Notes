# Notes App

This is a vanilla JS project that allows you to create and manage personal "post-it" style notes. The data is saved locally using the browser's local storage.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Adding a Note

Click on the "Add New" button to create a new note. Enter the note content in the input field and click "Add Note" to save the note.

### Editing a Note

To edit a note, click on the pencil icon next to the note. The note will open in the edit mode, where you can modify the content. Click "Save" to update the note.

### Removing a Note

To remove a note, click on the trash can icon next to the note. The note will be permanently deleted.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the app.
- `localStorageCreator.js`: A separate JavaScript file that retrieves and initializes notes from the local storage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the app.

## Styling

The app uses Bootstrap for basic styling. The notes are displayed as cards with a yellow background color.
